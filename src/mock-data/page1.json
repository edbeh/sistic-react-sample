  "synopsis": "A journey at sea in search of answers for one's existence, will never be complete without facing the wrath of the sea.\n\nWill all questions be answered or going astern be the solution?\n\nInspired by classic Persian poetry, Conference of The Birds written by Farid ud-Din Attar, Kebangkitan tells a story of an ark on a journey in search of answers for its existence and identity.\n\nIn its journey, engulfed by a mythical fog known as Mahaswara sets the ark astray reminding that answers can only be found through sheer will power.\n\nUpon reaching the promised land of answers, Kebangkitan was hit by a ferocious storm. Driven by the will, \"Never will Perish\", Kebangkitan fought hard. Welcomed by just an old man, will all questions be answered?â€‹",
